<h1>FLASTM CODE </h1>

Text Generation using LSTM (Brown Corpus)"
🔹 1. Package Installation & Import

!pip install nltk tensorflow pandas numpy
Installs required libraries. Then imports:

nltk: for downloading and processing the Brown corpus

tensorflow.keras: for building the LSTM

pandas, numpy: for data handling

🔹 2. Data Preparation from Brown Corpus


nltk.download('brown')
nltk.download('punkt')

from nltk.corpus import brown
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

paragraphs = brown.paras(categories='news')
Downloads NLTK datasets.

Selects news category paragraphs from Brown Corpus.

Tokenizes and flattens into sentences → words.

Then:


words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
Lowercases all text and tokenizes into words.

🔹 3. Tokenizer & Sequence Creation

tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token="<OOV>")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([words])
Builds vocabulary from words.

Handles out-of-vocabulary tokens using <OOV>.


# Create sequences of words
for i in range(1, len(words)):
    sequence = words[max(0, i-20):i]
    input_sequences.append(sequence)
Creates sliding window input sequences of 20 words each.

🔹 4. Convert to Integer Sequences + Padding

sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(input_sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_sequence_len, padding='pre')
Converts each word to its integer index and pads sequences to a uniform length.

🔹 5. Split Inputs and Outputs

xs = padded_sequences[:, :-1]  # input
ys = padded_sequences[:, -1]   # output
ys = to_categorical(ys, num_classes=total_words)
Splits data into xs (predictors) and ys (next word).

Converts ys to one-hot vectors.

🔹 6. Build & Train LSTM Model

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(total_words, 100, input_length=max_sequence_len-1))
model.add(LSTM(150))
model.add(Dense(total_words, activation='softmax'))
Embedding Layer: Maps tokens to dense vectors.

LSTM Layer: Learns sequence patterns.

Dense Softmax Layer: Predicts next word among vocabulary.


model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=20)
Trains the model for 20 epochs.

🔹 7. Save Model & Tokenizer

model.save_weights('brown_lstm.weights.h5')
with open('tokenizer.pkl', 'wb') as handle:
    pickle.dump(tokenizer, handle)
with open('max_sequence_len.pkl', 'wb') as handle:
    pickle.dump(max_sequence_len, handle)
Saves model weights.

Saves tokenizer and maximum sequence length for future use.

✅ What You Can Do With This:
Text generation: After training, you can give a seed sentence and let the model generate the next word(s).

Fine-tuning: Replace Brown corpus with custom datasets.

Deployment: Wrap into a Flask app or Colab demo.

Great question, bro! Let’s break it down in a super beginner-friendly way — like how you'd explain it to your younger sibling who just started coding. 🧃

🥒 What is pickle in Python?
pickle is a Python module used to save Python objects (like models, data structures, tokenizers, etc.) into a file — so that you can load them back later without re-creating them from scratch.

Think of pickle like zipping your data into a .pkl file, so you can:

🧠 Save your trained model or tokenizer

🔁 Reuse them later without retraining

📦 Transfer them to someone else easily

🐍 Example:
Let’s say you have a trained tokenizer object:

python
Copy
Edit
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
To save it:

python
Copy
Edit
import pickle

with open('tokenizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(tokenizer, f)
To load it later:

python
Copy
Edit
with open('tokenizer.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    tokenizer = pickle.load(f)
📌 What does .pkl mean?
.pkl is just the file extension used for files saved with pickle.

Just like:

.txt → text file

.csv → comma-separated values

.pkl → pickled Python object

🐷 Why is it called pickle?
Because you're preserving an object for later, like how we preserve cucumbers as pickles. Kinda cute, right? 🥒😄
